Users are granted access to Adobe products by adding them as members of a _product profile_ that has been created in the Admin Console. A product profile identifies an Adobe product or set of products, and is associated with a list of users who are entitled to access. You can use the API to add individual users to and remove individual users from specific product profiles.

You can also create _user groups_ in the Admin Console. You can use the API to manage both profiles and user groups: 

* You can add and remove users to manage membership in user groups.
* You can add and remove both users and user groups to manage membership in product profiles. 

Together, user groups and product profiles allow you to group users according to your own criteria, and then grant or deny product access to individuals and to entire groups.

_Note: You cannot create or manage product profiles themselves through the User Management API. For more information about creating and managing product profiles, see [Manage Product Profiles](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/help/admin-roles.html#Create_product_configurations) in the Enterprise help hub._
