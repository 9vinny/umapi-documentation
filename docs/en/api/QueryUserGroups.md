# Accessing User Group Information

User group information defined for your organization in theÂ [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/enterprise/) is available through the **{orgId}/user-groups** resource.

* Get a paged list of user groups defined for your organization:

```
GET [UM_Server]/{orgId}/user-groups
```
* Get information for a specific user group:

```
GET [UM_Server]/{orgId}/user-groups/{groupId}
```

## List User Groups

A GET request to the **/{orgId}/user-groups** resource retrieves a paged list of user groups that have been defined for your organization.

```json
GET [UM_Server]/{orgId}/user-groups[?page={n}]
```

* **{orgId}** : Required. The unique ID of your organization.
* **page={n}** : Optional. A zero-based index for the start entry of the paged response. Default is 0.

### Responses

A successful request returns a response with **HTTP status 200**. The response body contains the requested user-group data in JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "groupId": 28813981,
        "name": "UMSDK User Group",
        "type": "USER_GROUP",
        "userCount": 0
    },
    {
        "groupId": 28813990,
        "name": "UMSDK User Group 2",
        "type": "USER_GROUP",
        "userCount": 0
    },
    {
        "groupId": 28813993,
        "name": "UMSDK User Group 3",
        "type": "USER_GROUP",
        "userCount": 0
    }
]
```

A failed request can result in a response with one of these HTTP status values, with an error message in the response body:

* **400 Bad Request** : Some parameters of the request were not understood by the server.
* **401 Unauthorized** : Invalid or expired token.
* **403 Forbidden** : x-api-key header is missing.
* **404 Not Found** : groupId was not found.

_Note that server errors can occur that require exponential back-off on retry._
