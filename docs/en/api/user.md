An application can use the User Management API to access Adobe users and manage their identities.

## Retrieving Users

You can retrieve information for individual users, and list members of user groups and product profile groups.

* [Get user information -- `organizations/{orgId}/users/{userString}`](getUser.md)
* [Get all member users in a user group](getUsersByGroup.md)
* [Get all member users in a product profile group](getUsersByGroup.md)

## User Actions

You can create and remove user accounts for your organization, modify a userâ€™s personal information (depending on the account type).

Request these user-management actions from the [`action` resource](ActionsRef.md) for your organization.
```
POST v2/usermanagement/action/{orgId}
```

The _commands_ in the body of your POST request specify _action steps_ to take for a given _user_.

* Create or add a user to an organization
 + [addAdobeId](ActionsCmds.md#addAdobeID) Create or add an Adobe ID user
 + [createEnterpriseID](ActionsCmds.md#createEnterpriseID) Create an Enterprise ID user
 + [createFederatedID](ActionsCmds.md#createFederatedID) Create an Federated ID user.
* [update](ActionsCmds.md#update) Update an existing user in an organization
* [remove](ActionsCmds.md#removeFromOrg) Remove a user from an organization

You can also use `action` requests to modify users' memberships and administrative roles. See [User Group APIs](group.md) and [Product APIs](product.md) for details.
